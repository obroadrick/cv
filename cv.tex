\section*{Research Experience}

\subsection*{Statistical Election Audits (2020-Present)}
Worked with \href{https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~poorvi/}{Professor Poorvi Vora} and 
\href{https://zagorski.im.pwr.wroc.pl/}{Professor Filip Zag\`{o}rski} on post-election
Risk-Limiting Audits (RLAs). An RLA guarantees with known probability that incorrectly
announced election results will be detected and corrected.
I have developed novel mathematical methods for ballot-polling audits and stratified audits, 
and I have written a significant portion of the open-source audit software library 
\href{https://github.com/gwexploratoryaudits/r2b2}{r2b2}.

\subsection*{Hotel Image Recognition (2021-Present)}
Images taken in hotel rooms appear in human trafficking investigations. 
Recent work by \href{https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/}{Professor Pless} and others
produced a database of over a million hotel room images
and a recognition search tool used by the National Center for Missing an Exploited Children.
With Professor Pless and three peers, I am working
on asearch utility that uses key points for recognition when query images have high occlusion.

\subsection*{Imprecise Scheduling (2021-Present)}
Working with \href{https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~narahari/}{Professor Bhagi Narahari} to 
develop novel scheduling algorithm for neural network tasks using an imprecise computation
model. Progress is partially reflected in 
\href{https://github.com/obroadrick/imprecise}{software repository}.
