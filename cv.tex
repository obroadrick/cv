\section*{Research}

Keen to explore, I've worked on projects in security, systems, and computer vision. 

\subsection*{Single image camera calibration with glitter (2022-present)}
Camera calibration -- estimation of camera pose and intrinsic properties like focal length -- is a classic problem in computer vision with traditional methods requiring dozens of images for high accuracy. Using the strong geometric constraints provided by sparkling glitter, we are developing single image camera calibration.

\subsection*{Post-election statistical audits (2020-present)}
In a Risk-Limiting Audit (RLA), a random sample of paper ballots and a rigorous statistical test are used to guarantee with known probability that incorrect election results are detected and corrected.
Among other work, I have developed \Providence a novel mathematical method for ballot polling RLAs, the most efficient and secure RLA of its kind.

\subsection*{Scheduling for real-time AI at the edge (2021-2022)}
I designed and analyzed scheduling algorithms with the imprecise computation model for real-time AI tasks at the edge.
