\section*{Research Experience}

\subsection*{Statistical Election Audits (2020-Present)}
Worked with \href{https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~poorvi/}{Professor Poorvi Vora} and 
\href{https://zagorski.im.pwr.wroc.pl/}{Professor Filip Zag\`{o}rski} on post-election
Risk-Limiting Audits (RLAs). An RLA guarantees with known probability that incorrectly
announced election results will be detected and corrected.
I have developed novel mathematical methods for ballot-polling audits and stratified audits, 
and I have written a significant portion of the open-source audit software library 
\href{https://github.com/gwexploratoryaudits/r2b2}{r2b2}.

\subsection*{Hotel Image Recognition (2021-Present)}
With \href{https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/}{Professor Pless} and three peers, I am working
on a search utility that uses key points to improve on existing hotel recognition methods,
especially for query images with high occlusion.
An existing search utility is used by the National Center for Missing an Exploited Children
for sex trafficking investigations.

\subsection*{Imprecise Scheduling (2021-Present)}
Working with \href{https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~narahari/}{Professor Bhagi Narahari} to 
develop novel scheduling algorithm for neural network tasks using an imprecise computation
model. Progress is partially reflected in 
\href{https://github.com/obroadrick/imprecise}{software repository}.
